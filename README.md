24/01/2023 - Tried adding a screen and messed up how everything is positioned and sized. I'll need to fool around with this later but I think I'm on the right track. I'm tempted to use grid-template-area instead of what I'm doing but we will see how it goes.

18/01/2023 - First day of the last exercise of "Fundamentals". I'm excited to be finished this and move on to using APIs and doing the big stuff. I have some ideas on how I want to make this calculator and I don't think it will be that hard with chatGPT.
